## Differential gene expression scripts

Scripts that I wrote to assess the extent of differential gene expression in *Populus balsamifera*, and to estimate rates of molecular evolution on differentially expressed genes.

2. [subsetBlastResults.R](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/genomics-scripts/blob/master/gene-expression/subsetBlastHits.R) An R script that I wrote to try to select the best homolog for *P. trichocarpa* sequences in *P. tremula* and *P. euphratica* based on BLAST results. See comments in the header to run from the command line using Rscript
