## Sex-biased gene expression in flowers, but not leaves, reveals secondary sexual dimorphism in *Populus balsamifera*

This repository contains the data, scripts, and analysis files used for the
analysis reported in my paper [Sex-biased gene expression in flowers, but not leaves,
reveals secondary sexual dimorphism in *Populus balsamifera*](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15421),
published in the journal [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14698137)
in 2019.

### Contents

1. [README.md](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/README.md): this file

2. [R/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/R/): A directory of R scripts I used for this analysis. These scripts are called from within the Jupyter analysis notebook.

3. [data/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/data/): A directory containing read count data from *Populus balsamifera* leaf and flower RNA libraries.

4. [notebooks/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/notebooks): Notebooks that detail the analyses reported in the manuscript, in both Jupyter and R Markdown Notebook formats
