## Sex-biased gene expression in flowers, but not leaves, reveals secondary sexual dimorphism in *Populus balsamifera*

This repository contains the data, scripts, and analysis files used for a forthcoming manuscript reporting the patterns of expression and molecular evolution of sex-biased genes in *Populus balsamifera*
 
### Contents

1. [README.md](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/README.md): this file

2. [R/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/R/): A directory of R scripts I used for this analysis. These scripts are called from within the Jupyter analysis notebook.

3. [data/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/data/): A directory containing read count data from *Populus balsamifera* leaf and flower RNA libraries.

4. [DGEanalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/gene-expression/blob/master/DGEanalysis.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that includes the R code used for the analysis of differential gene expression for this project.
